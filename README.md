# Flashcard-Generator

### Instructions

* Upon downloading the file, use the command line and run "node generator.js" to get started.

* The program will prompt you through a few options. You can pull an existing card, create a new basic, front and back, flashcard, or you can create a Cloze Deleted flashcard that removes part of the text and requires the user to fill it in.
