/*This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating basic flashcards, e.g.:
module.exports = BasicCard;

The constructor should accept two arguments: front and back.
The constructed object should have a front property that contains the text on the front of the card.
The constructed object should have a back property that contains the text on the back of the card.*/
